README document for Group ID: G7




We have 4 code files as we have used 4 models, 2 models each for question 1 and 2


Code Files:
Question 1)
        1) FeedForward Network (FFN): SC4002_G7_Q1_FNN.ipynb
* Please convert the files to a csv file format in the following manner:
   * "eng.train.csv"
   * "eng.testa.csv"
   * "eng.testb.csv"
* The filepath for the file location is stored in a google drive, with the path being "./drive/MyDrive/SC4002"
* Do note that current results are saved in the file, if re-ran, might have a different final result. 


        2) Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM): SC4002_G7_Q1_LSTM
* Please download the files in the original file format in the following manner:
   * “eng.train”
   * “eng.testa”
   * “eng.testb”
* Upload to files in Google Colab runtime


Question 2)
Ensure that the train and test datasets are in your working directory during runtime (“train.csv”, “test.csv”)
        1) FeedForward Network (FFN): SC4002_G7_Q2_FNN
        2) Long Short Term Memory (LSTM): SC4002_G7_Q2_LSTM




Instructions to run:


- Code provided is in Python
- Open and run in your desired IDE (VSCode, Jupyter-Noteboook, google colab, etc...)
- Output obtained in the code all come with explanations in markdown cells
